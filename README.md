# VulkanEngine

Vulkan rendering engine, made mainly by following https://vkguide.dev/ at first.

This is my main side project, outside of College and work.

Right now, I'm still working on the tutorial but the last parts, especially the GPU driven rendering and the beginning of "bindless rendering".

When it will be done, I'm planning to expand on it to try my hand at other subjects like using other APIs, other rendering method (deferred rendering, forward+, Vulkan Ray Tracing, Entity Component System, etc.).

This is mostly a learning project.
